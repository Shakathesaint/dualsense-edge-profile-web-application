=== ANALYSIS OF 'Test curve' PROFILE ===

--- RIGHT STICK ANALYSIS ---
Modifier from buffer1[53]: 4 (0x04)
ProfileId from buffer2[32]: 2 (PRECISE)
Curve values: [85, 40, 149, 83, 206, 140]

Trying to match with PRECISE profile:
  Ô£à MATCH at slider index 5! (represents slider position 0)

--- LEFT STICK ANALYSIS ---
Modifier from buffer1[44]: 3 (0x03)
ProfileId from buffer2[30]: 0 (DEFAULT)
Curve values: [163, 147, 212, 205, 233, 229]

DEFAULT profile values: [128, 128, 196, 196, 225, 225]
Actual values: [163, 147, 212, 205, 233, 229]
Match: NO

=== KEY FINDINGS ===
1. buffer1[60-61] = [0, 0] - Empty!
2. buffer2[2-3] = [206, 140] - Contains the actual curve data
3. Current code reads from buffer2[2-3] which appears CORRECT
4. The discrepancy might be in HOW the ProfileId/modifier bytes are used
