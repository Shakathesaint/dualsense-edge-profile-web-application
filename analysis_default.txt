=== DEFAULT PROFILE DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS ===

Expected (our code):   128, 128, 196, 196, 225, 225
Actual (from device):  163, 147, 212, 205, 233, 229

Differences:
  Point 0: 128 ÔåÆ 163 (diff: +35)
  Point 1: 128 ÔåÆ 147 (diff: +19)
  Point 2: 196 ÔåÆ 212 (diff: +16)
  Point 3: 196 ÔåÆ 205 (diff: +9)
  Point 4: 225 ÔåÆ 233 (diff: +8)
  Point 5: 225 ÔåÆ 229 (diff: +4)

=== HYPOTHESIS: Maybe DEFAULT in official app HAS modifiers ===
Let's reverse-engineer what the modifier pattern might be:

If these ARE the base values (index 0), then modifiers would need to produce them from index 5:

=== ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS ===
What if our slider index interpretation is INVERTED?
Official app slider 0 = our slider index 10? Let's check...

STEADY profile at various indices:
Index 0: [62, 62, 120, 129, 197, 179]
Index 1: [61, 61, 116, 129, 200, 174]
Index 2: [60, 60, 112, 128, 202, 168]
Index 3: [59, 59, 108, 128, 205, 163]
Index 4: [58, 58, 104, 127, 207, 157]
Index 5: [57, 57, 100, 127, 210, 152]
Index 6: [56, 56, 96, 126, 212, 146]
Index 7: [55, 55, 92, 126, 215, 141]
Index 8: [54, 54, 88, 125, 217, 135]
Index 9: [53, 53, 84, 125, 220, 130]
Index 10: [52, 52, 80, 124, 222, 124]

=== CONCLUSION ===
The actual values [163, 147, 212, 205, 233, 229] don't match any known profile.
This strongly suggests our hardcoded profile curves are INCORRECT for DEFAULT.

Possible root causes:
1. The official PS app uses different formulas than we have hardcoded
2. There's a different mapping between Profile IDs and curve types
3. The DEFAULT profile in official app actually HAS slider modifiers (unlike our static version)
